### 2. **E-commerce Functionality:**
   - **Online Store**: Allow customers to purchase fresh produce, dairy, or meat products directly from the farm.

   - **Customer Testimonials**: Share feedback from satisfied customers to build credibility.

### 7. **Market and Supply Chain Connections:**
   - **Wholesale Inquiries**: Provide a section for bulk buyers (like grocery stores or restaurants) to contact the farm for large orders.
